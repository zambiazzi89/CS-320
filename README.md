Assignments for CS-320 Software Test Automation &amp; QA

Q1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
A1. To ensure that the application is functional and secure it is important to define requirements that cover the desired functionalities and security factors. This allows teams to focus on practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) that mitigate errors and bugs in development.

Q2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
A2. User needs must be converted into requirements that can be tested, verified, and validated. In a previous class, IT-315 Object Oriented Analysis/Design, I learned that there are various ways to identify and define application requirements. More specifically, we can identify Use Cases, Actors, and Functional, Structural, and Behavioral Models, which allows teams to identify, define, verify and validate requirements. However, in this class, the user needs had already been identified and provided as the requirements for each application. These requirements were then converted into test cases that delineate the expected behavior for the application. 

Q3. How do I approach designing software?
A3. There are a various concepts that can be followed by the developer when designing software, such as Abstraction, Modularity, and Data Structures. In this class, we were provided the module structures that the applications should consist of. However, we had the opportunity to explore concepts like Abstraction, Data Structures, and Information Hiding when designing the application. For example, I chose to use hash tables to store class instances, as well as making private variables only accessible through public methods.
